You're absolutely right! At **42 School**, it's customary to prefix typedef'ed types with `t_` to clearly indicate that they are type definitions. Therefore, instead of naming the typedef as `Node`, it would typically be named `t_node`. This naming convention enhances code readability and maintains consistency across projects.

Let's update the previous implementation to adhere to **42 School**'s naming conventions by using `t_node` instead of `Node`. We'll also include a `main` function to demonstrate the usage.

---

### **1. Updated Implementation Following 42 School's Conventions**

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Typedef for t_node to simplify syntax
typedef struct s_node {
    int data;
    struct s_node *next;
} t_node;

// Function to create a new t_node
t_node *new_node(int data) {
    t_node *temp;

    temp = malloc(sizeof(t_node));
    if (!temp)
    {
        perror("Failed to allocate memory for new node");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    temp->data = data;
    temp->next = NULL;
    return temp;
}

// Function to print the linked list
void print_list(t_node *head) {
    t_node *current = head;
    while (current != NULL)
    {
        printf("%d -> ", current->data);
        current = current->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");
}

// Main function to demonstrate the linked list
int main(void) {
    // Creating nodes
    t_node *head = new_node(10);
    head->next = new_node(20);
    head->next->next = new_node(30);

    // Printing the linked list
    print_list(head);

    // Freeing allocated memory
    t_node *current = head;
    t_node *next_node;
    while (current != NULL)
    {
        next_node = current->next;
        free(current);
        current = next_node;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### **2. Line-by-Line Explanation of the Updated 42 School Implementation**

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
```

- **`#include <stdlib.h>`**: Includes the standard library for memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`) and other utility functions.
    
- **`#include <stdio.h>`**: Includes the standard I/O library for functions like `printf` and `perror`.
    

```c
// Typedef for t_node to simplify syntax
typedef struct s_node {
    int data;
    struct s_node *next;
} t_node;
```

- **`typedef struct s_node { ... } t_node;`**:
    - **`struct s_node`**: Defines a structure named `s_node`.
    - **`int data;`**: Stores integer data.
    - **`struct s_node *next;`**: Pointer to the next node in the linked list.
    - **`typedef ... t_node;`**: Creates an alias `t_node` for `struct s_node`, allowing us to use `t_node` instead of `struct s_node` in the code. This follows the 42 School convention of prefixing typedef'ed types with `t_`.

```c
// Function to create a new t_node
t_node *new_node(int data) {
    t_node *temp;

    temp = malloc(sizeof(t_node));
    if (!temp)
    {
        perror("Failed to allocate memory for new node");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    temp->data = data;
    temp->next = NULL;
    return temp;
}
```

- **`t_node *new_node(int data) { ... }`**: Function to create and initialize a new node with the given `data`.
    
- **`t_node *temp;`**: Declares a pointer `temp` of type `t_node*`.
    
- **`temp = malloc(sizeof(t_node));`**:
    
    - Allocates memory sufficient for one `t_node`.
    - **No casting of `malloc`'s return value**, adhering to C best practices and 42 School's guidelines.
- **`if (!temp) { ... }`**:
    
    - Checks if `malloc` returned `NULL`, indicating a memory allocation failure.
    - **`perror`**: Prints a descriptive error message to `stderr`.
    - **`exit(EXIT_FAILURE);`**: Terminates the program with a failure status.
- **`temp->data = data;`**: Assigns the provided `data` to the new node.
    
- **`temp->next = NULL;`**: Initializes the `next` pointer to `NULL`.
    
- **`return temp;`**: Returns the pointer to the newly created node.
    

```c
// Function to print the linked list
void print_list(t_node *head) {
    t_node *current = head;
    while (current != NULL)
    {
        printf("%d -> ", current->data);
        current = current->next;
    }
    printf("NULL\n");
}
```

- **`void print_list(t_node *head) { ... }`**: Function to traverse and print the linked list starting from `head`.
    
- **`t_node *current = head;`**: Initializes a pointer `current` to traverse the list.
    
- **`while (current != NULL) { ... }`**:
    
    - Iterates through each node in the list.
    - **`printf("%d -> ", current->data);`**: Prints the `data` of the current node followed by an arrow.
    - **`current = current->next;`**: Moves to the next node.
- **`printf("NULL\n");`**: Indicates the end of the list.
    

```c
// Main function to demonstrate the linked list
int main(void) {
    // Creating nodes
    t_node *head = new_node(10);
    head->next = new_node(20);
    head->next->next = new_node(30);

    // Printing the linked list
    print_list(head);

    // Freeing allocated memory
    t_node *current = head;
    t_node *next_node;
    while (current != NULL)
    {
        next_node = current->next;
        free(current);
        current = next_node;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

- **`int main(void) { ... }`**: The entry point of the program.
    
- **Creating Nodes**:
    
    - **`t_node *head = new_node(10);`**: Creates the head node with data `10`.
    - **`head->next = new_node(20);`**: Creates the second node with data `20` and links it to the head.
    - **`head->next->next = new_node(30);`**: Creates the third node with data `30` and links it to the second node.
- **Printing the Linked List**:
    
    - **`print_list(head);`**: Calls the `print_list` function to display the linked list.
- **Freeing Allocated Memory**:
    
    - **`t_node *current = head;`**: Starts from the head of the list.
    - **`t_node *next_node;`**: Temporary pointer to store the next node.
    - **`while (current != NULL) { ... }`**:
        - Iterates through each node.
        - **`next_node = current->next;`**: Saves the next node.
        - **`free(current);`**: Frees the memory allocated for the current node.
        - **`current = next_node;`**: Moves to the next node.
- **`return 0;`**: Indicates successful program termination.

### **3. Compilation and Execution**

To compile and run the updated program:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o linked_list linked_list.c
./linked_list
```

**Expected Output:**

```
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL
```

### **4. Summary of Naming Conventions and Best Practices at 42 School**

1. **Prefixing Typedef'ed Types with `t_`**:
    
    - **Example**: `t_node` instead of `Node`.
    - **Purpose**: Clearly distinguishes type definitions from other identifiers, enhancing code readability.
2. **Avoiding Unnecessary Casting of `malloc`**:
    
    - **Rationale**: In C, `malloc` returns a `void*`, which is implicitly convertible to any other pointer type. Casting can sometimes mask errors, especially in C++ where it could lead to ambiguities.
3. **Using `typedef` for Structs**:
    
    - **Benefit**: Simplifies the syntax by eliminating the need to repeatedly write `struct`.
    - **Example**: `typedef struct s_node { ... } t_node;` allows using `t_node` directly.
4. **Robust Error Handling**:
    
    - **Practice**: Always check the return value of `malloc` (or other memory allocation functions) to ensure that memory allocation was successful.
    - **Implementation**: Use `perror` and `exit` to handle allocation failures gracefully.
5. **Consistent Coding Style**:
    
    - **Focus**: Adhering to strict formatting and naming conventions to maintain code consistency and readability.
    - **Tools**: Often enforced using tools like `norminette` at 42 School.
6. **Memory Management**:
    
    - **Emphasis**: Proper allocation and deallocation of memory to prevent leaks.
    - **Implementation**: Ensure that every `malloc` has a corresponding `free`.

By following these conventions, the code not only becomes more readable and maintainable but also aligns with industry best practices, which is highly valued at **42 School** and beyond.

### **5. Final Thoughts**

Adhering to specific naming conventions and coding standards, such as those emphasized at **42 School**, fosters a disciplined approach to programming. It ensures that codebases remain consistent, readable, and maintainable, especially as projects scale in complexity. Implementing these best practices from the outset can significantly enhance both individual and collaborative development efforts.
