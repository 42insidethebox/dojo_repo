Absolutely. Here’s your second note: `[[asymmetric_pthreads/02_pthread_deadlock_simulation]]` — documenting a deliberate **deadlock trap** for full internalization of mutex locking order.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>

pthread_mutex_t	mutex1 = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
pthread_mutex_t	mutex2 = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void	*thread1_fn(void *arg)
{
	(void)arg;
	printf("Thread 1 locking mutex 1 ... \n");
	pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex1);
	sleep(1);
	printf("Thread 1 locking mutex 2 ... \n");
	pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex2);

	printf("Thread 1 acquired both mutexes ! \n");
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex2);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex1);
	return (NULL);
}

void	*thread2_fn(void *arg)

### 🔥 **This File Will Deadlock**

```ad-warning
title: What Happens
- Thread 1 locks `mutex1` → sleeps → tries to lock `mutex2`
- Thread 2 locks `mutex2` → sleeps → tries to lock `mutex1`
- Both threads now **waiting forever**
```

---

### 🧠 **What You Learn**

- **Deadlocks** occur when threads **hold one lock** and **wait on another**
    
- Lock **acquisition order matters**
    
- `sleep()` makes race conditions predictable → great for learning
    
- You need a consistent global **locking order policy**
    

---

### 🛠️ **How to Fix It**

> Ensure both threads **acquire mutexes in the same order**

```c
// Both threads should always: lock mutex1 first, then mutex2
```

---

### 🧪 **Expected Output (Before Freezing)**

```
Thread 1 locking mutex 1 ...
Thread 2 locking mutex 2 ...
Thread 1 locking mutex 2 ...
Thread 2 locking mutex 1 ...
[Program freezes here — deadlock]
```

### ✅ Checklist

-  Simulates real-world deadlock
    
-  No crash, but infinite wait
    
-  Demonstrates the **danger of inconsistent lock order**
    
-  Teachable fix exists via ordering discipline

## 🎯 Mission

This file is **not** about just seeing a deadlock.  
It’s about **feeling the illusion of progress** — while your threads are locked in a death hug 🤝💀.

We will now dissect, refactor, and truth-bomb the file line by line.

**Next message** will contain:

- Refactored `.c` file ✅
    
- Asymmetric breakdown 🤯
    
- Vault-formatted Obsidian entry 📦
    

Let’s begin.

## 🧠 What You _Think_ You're Learning

> “Oh cool, threads need locks so they don’t mess up shared data!”

---

## 💣 What You're Actually Learning (The Asymmetry)

|👀 Surface Code|💥 Reality|
|---|---|
|Each thread locks 2 mutexes|They lock them in **opposite order**|
|`sleep(1)` is for show|It’s a **deadlock trap trigger**|
|Code looks correct|**No crash**, just... 🧊 stuck.|
|You `join()` both|You’ll **wait forever** — you just froze main() too.|
|Only 2 threads|Yet they can halt an entire server if this logic leaks into prod.|

---

## 📉 Timeline of Doom

```
Thread 1 locks mutex1
Thread 2 locks mutex2
Thread 1 tries to lock mutex2... (blocked)
Thread 2 tries to lock mutex1... (blocked)
...forever...
```

> **Deadlock = mutual wait with no escape.**

---

## 🧪 How to Observe It

```bash
$ ./a.out
🔐 Thread 1 locking mutex1...
🔐 Thread 2 locking mutex2...
🔐 Thread 1 locking mutex2...
🔐 Thread 2 locking mutex1...
```

🎯 Then: **nothing.**

🧊 CPU flatlines.  
🧃 `htop` shows threads stuck.  
🐌 `strace` hangs on `futex()`.

---

## 🧠 Truth Bombs 💣

```ad-warning
title: This Will Happen to You in Real Life
- In production, deadlocks don’t crash.
- They cause infinite spin, memory starvation, or client timeouts.
- And when you attach a debugger... they behave.
```

---

## 🛡️ How to Defuse It

### 🔢 1. Always lock mutexes in the **same order** across threads.

```c
// both threads: lock mutex1, then mutex2
```

### 💬 2. Add timeout logic (e.g. `pthread_mutex_timedlock()`)

### 🔍 3. Add detection logs: “Waiting for mutex2…”

---

## ✅ Checklist

|🔍 Thing|Status|
|---|---|
|Uses two mutexes|✅|
|Opposite lock order|✅|
|Induces deadlock|✅|
|No crash, silent freeze|✅|
|Educationally asymmetric|✅|
|Real-world observable?|✅ — traceable with `strace`|

## 🧠 Asymmetric Principle Here

> You don't need many threads to fail.  
> Just **two mutexes, locked the wrong way** — and you take down the system.

Shall we proceed to `[[asymmetric_pthreads/03_pthread_exit_and_cleanup]]`, or do you want to patch this into a recovery variant first?
