Absolutely. Let’s dissect `[[asymmetric_pthreads/17_malloc_leak_detached_threads]]` — one of the **sneakiest, most common, and most expensive** bugs in multithreaded systems.

# 💥 `[[asymmetric_pthreads/17_malloc_leak_detached_threads]]`

### 🧠 _"No Join, No Free, No Mercy."_

## 📂 Source: `17_malloc_leak_detached_threads.c`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define THREADS 5

void	*worker(void *arg)
{
	int	index = *(int *)arg;
	char	*data = malloc(100);

	if (!data)
	{
		perror("malloc failed");
		pthread_exit(NULL);
	}
	snprintf(data, 100, "Hello from thread %d\n", index);
	printf("%s", data);
	usleep(100000); // simulate work

	// OOPS: we never free(data)
	return (NULL); // and main never join()s us
}

int	main(void)
{
	pthread_t	t[THREADS];
	int			ids[THREADS];

	for (int i = 0; i < THREADS; i++)
	{
		ids[i] = i;
		if (pthread_create(&t[i], NULL, worker, &ids[i]) != 0)
		{
			perror("pthread_create failed");
			exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
		}
		pthread_detach(t[i]); // ← we're detaching immediately
	}

	printf("Main is done launching detached threads.\n");
	sleep(1);
	printf("Main exits without joining or cleanup.\n");
	return (0);
}
```

## 🧩 What This Code _Looks Like_ It Does

✅ Creates 5 threads  
✅ Each thread prints a string  
✅ Detaches them (so main doesn't need to join)  
✅ Program exits

---

## 💣 What It **Actually** Does

|🔥 Hidden Behavior|Consequence|
|---|---|
|`malloc()` in thread|Allocates memory ✅|
|`free()` is never called|💥 memory leak|
|Thread is `detached`|No way to recover memory after `pthread_exit()`|
|No `pthread_join()`|Main can’t synchronize or clean up|
|Program exits after 1s|May exit before some threads finish|

---

## 🧠 Mental Model Upgrade: Detach = Fire-and-Forget

When you call `pthread_detach()`, you’re telling the OS:

> “Hey, I’m never gonna join this thread.  
> Just **clean up the memory and return value automatically** when it’s done.”

But:  
🛑 That **only cleans up the thread struct**, _not_ the heap allocations the thread makes.

So if your thread `malloc()`s something — and you never `free()` it — it **leaks**, even if the thread itself terminates correctly.

## 🧪 Valgrind Output (Simplified)

```bash
==12345== HEAP SUMMARY:
==12345==    definitely lost: 500 bytes in 5 blocks
==12345==    indirectly lost: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==12345==    still reachable: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==12345==    suppressed: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
```

📉 That’s 5 threads × 100 bytes = **500 leaked bytes**  
Now imagine doing this in a real server 1000s of times per day. 💸

---

## ✅ How to Fix

### Option 1: Free the memory inside the thread

```c
free(data);
return (NULL);
```

### Option 2: Avoid `detach()`, and collect the result via `pthread_join()`

This is what **real daemons do** — they **don’t leak**, they **track**:

```c
pthread_join(t[i], NULL);
```

---

## 🧠 Truth Bomb

```ad-warning
title: “Detached” Means Nobody Is Watching
- No join = no ability to wait
- No wait = no chance to capture returned values
- No return handling = no cleanup
```

---

## 🧠 Why This Is Asymmetric

> Because **you’d never know it’s leaking** unless:
> 
> - You ran `valgrind`
>     
> - Or the program ran long enough to **blow up memory**
>     
> - Or you **analyzed code flow** and saw malloc without free
>     

Most developers don’t spot this until it costs **millions of bytes** in production.
